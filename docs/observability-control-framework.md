# Observability Control Framework (OCF)  
**A Cloud-Native Observability Governance Framework Built on OpenTelemetry & CNCF Best Practices**  

## Overview  

The **Observability Control Framework (OCF)** provides a structured approach to implementing **logs, metrics, traces, and event-driven observability** in **cloud-native environments**. Inspired by **OpenTelemetry and NIST**, OCF offers a standardized set of **controls** to enhance system visibility, reliability, and performance.
