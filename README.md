# Observability Control Framework (OCF)

A Cloud-Native Observability Governance Framework Built on OpenTelemetry & CNCF Best Practices

The **Observability Control Framework (OCF)** provides structured **best practices, operational controls, and governance models** for implementing **logs, metrics, traces, and event-driven observability** in modern cloud-native environments.

---

## Why OCF?

**OpenTelemetry-Centric** – Built around **OpenTelemetry (OTel)** for vendor-neutral observability.  
**Cloud-Native Focus** – Designed for **Kubernetes, microservices, serverless, and distributed systems**.  
**NIST & DORA Alignment** – Inspired by **NIST 800-53**, **DORA metrics**, and **modern SRE principles**.  
**Scalable & Actionable** – Provides **clear observability controls, automation strategies, and incident response frameworks**.  

---

## What’s Inside?

**Standardized Observability Controls** for identifying, instrumenting, collecting, detecting, responding, and optimizing telemetry data.  
**Integration with CNCF & OpenTelemetry Best Practices** for unified cloud monitoring.  
**DORA Metrics Framework** for measuring **Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, Change Failure Rate, and MTTR**.  
**Actionable Guidance for Logs, Metrics, Traces, and Events** to enhance **visibility, reliability, and performance monitoring**.
